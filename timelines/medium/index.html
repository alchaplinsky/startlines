            Something referred to as Medium was built. They had real code, a working product and a desire to ship something. At that time there were 3 designers: Dustin Senos, Leigh Taylor and Dann Petty. Dustin was doing double-duty as a developer and designer while Dann and Leigh focused on design.

            Medium, a blog-publishing platform, was founded by Twitter co-founders Evan Williams and Biz Stone. The platform has evolved into a hybrid of non-professional contributions and professional, paid contributions, an example of social journalism.

            Medium has been described as “a cross between Tumblr and Pinterest.” Like Tumblr, it relies on artfully constructed templates for its structural power; like Pinterest, it’s designed to be image-heavy. But those surface issues, while interesting, are less consequential than the underlying structure of Medium, which upends much of how we think about personal publishing online.

            Medium has relaunched Matter, the British tech publication, as the focus of its publishing efforts, admitting for the first time that it is a publisher as well as a publishing platform. The original version of Matter, a British science and technology journalism startup has been quietly closed after the relaunch. Its former editor, Bobbie Johnson, previously  a Guardian reporter, remains involved with the project and still works  at Medium, but Matter will now be edited by Mark Lotto, formerly a senior editor at GQ.

Medium is turning the tables and moving into Tumblr’s territory instead with a series of changes that encourage writers to share stories of any  length – even shorter posts and incomplete thoughts. Changes: no title required, simple formatting options, one click publishing into your stream.
