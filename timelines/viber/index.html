            Viber scored 1 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's secure messaging scorecard. Viber received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider doesn't  have access to, users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen, the code is not open to independent review, the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent security audit.
